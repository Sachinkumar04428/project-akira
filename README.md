# Artificial Knowledge and Information Retrieval Assistant

Note: This project is in early phases of its development 

In short, Akira is an information retrieval bot. On top of that, we plan to add the logic for information synthesis. 
The core idea is to build a bot that assists the user in doing online research for them, for writing an article, creating content or gathering more information about something interactively and engagingly.

Basic objectives:
- Able to retrieve key information from online sources based on the queries of the user.
- Able to help a content creator in ideation and development.
- Able to answer general questions that a user can ask.
- Able to ask typical questions to the user about their thoughts on the topic in research.
- Based on the interaction with the user and the information gathered online, the bot should be able to draft a short article of its own.
- Capable of suggesting new ideas for viral content creation based on latest online trends.

The bot is being built in python using the open source rasa stack. Stay tuned as we update the project from time to time.
